Probably took about an hour total to install/setup git and vscode.

Day 1 probably took about an hour (or a little more).
Moderate difficulty anticipating modulo behavior, ended up with special handling for L ops.
A more clever solution would be transforming L ops into R ops.

Day 2 took about half an hour.
Minor difficulty accounting for double counts.

Day 3 took about half an hour.
Little difficulty except for an off-by-one on the buffer.

Day 4 took a little more than half an hour.
Minor difficulty thinking through recursion.

Day 5 took about half an hour.
Little difficulty except for a highly inefficient naive solution.
The LLM autocompletion was surprisingly good at this one.
