Probably took about an hour total to install/setup git and vscode.

Day 1 probably took about an hour (or a little more).
Moderate difficulty anticipating modulo behavior, ended up with special handling for L ops.
A more clever solution would be transforming L ops into R ops.
The LLM misunderstood the context from my filename.

Day 2 took about half an hour.
Minor difficulty accounting for double counts.

Day 3 took about half an hour.
Little difficulty except for an off-by-one on the buffer.

Day 4 took a little more than half an hour.
Minor difficulty thinking through recursion.

Day 5 took about half an hour.
Little difficulty except for a highly inefficient naive solution.
The LLM was surprisingly good at this one.

Day 6 took about an hour.
Moderate difficulty framing part 2 correctly.
Wanted to reuse earlier partial solution with a transformation.
Ended up with a very literal approach due to cephalopod writing rules.
The LLM was especially useless for this one.

Overall the LLM increased efficiency by around 10% I'd say.
Mostly by saving time looking up syntax (although it did provide some bad syntax as well).
Less useful than an intern and cannot be trusted.
